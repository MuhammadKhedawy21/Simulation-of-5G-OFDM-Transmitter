Simulation-of-5G-OFDM-Transmitter using python: <br />
This project is the simulation of a downlink OFDM signal assuming single port output i.e.,no MIMO. The signal consists of samples spaced Tc apart and using the NR number of sub-carriers and subcarrier spacing as specified in TS 38.101-1 (FR1 Range). The user is allowed to chose the desired configuration. For the chosen channel bandwidth and subcarrier spacing, the OFDM data is generated for 100 frames and the Peak to Average power ratio(PAPR) is calculated and plotted for QPSK,16-QAM, and 64-QAM modulation techniques.
